<h1>Problem Description</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Wumpus World</h2>
<hr>
The Wumpus world is a simple world example to illustrate the worth of a knowledge-based agent and to represent knowledge representation.

The figure below shows a Wumpus world containing one pit and one Wumpus. There is an agent in room [1,1]. The goal of the agent is to exit the Wumpus world alive. The agent can exit the Wumpus world by reaching room [4,4]. The wumpus world contains exactly one Wumpus and one pit. There will be a breeze in the rooms adjacent to the pit, and there will be a stench in the rooms adjacent to Wumpus.

<center>Wumpus World Representation</center>
<p>
This is a python program that uses propositional logic sentences to check which rooms are safe. 

It is assumed that there will always be a safe path that the agent can take to exit the Wumpus world. The logical agent can take four actions: Up, Down, Left and Right. These actions help the agent move from one room to an adjacent room. The agent can perceive two things: Breeze and Stench.
